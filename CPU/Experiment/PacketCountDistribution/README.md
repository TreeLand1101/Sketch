# Packet Count Distribution
We analyze the raw packet-count distributions of network traces before and after filtering.

To simulate the filtering scheme for Stage 1, we employed a 128 KB CM Sketch and configured the heavy-hitter threshold at 0.0001 of the total packet count. We update the sketch on each packet; once a flowâ€™s estimate meets the threshold, we mark it as a retained flow and count all its subsequent packets in the retained packet count.

### C++
- `cmake`
- `g++`
