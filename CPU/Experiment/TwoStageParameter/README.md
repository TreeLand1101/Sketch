# Two-Stage Parameter
The Two-Stage framework efficacy depends critically on two tunable parameters: 
1.  Memory ratio between Stage 1 and Stage 2 
2.  Admission ratio.

We select these parameters based on experimental results.

## Requirements
### C++
- `cmake`
- `g++`

### Python (only used for plotting)
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`

## How to run
```bash
$ cmake .
$ sh run.sh
```
